# The nth term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by, t_n = Â½n(n+1); 
# so the first ten triangle numbers are:

# 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

# By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding to its 
# alphabetical position and adding these values we form a word value. For 
# example, the word value for SKY is 19 + 11 + 25 = 55 = t_10. If the word 
# value is a triangle number then we shall call the word a triangle word.

# Using words.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 16K text file 
# containing nearly two-thousand common English words, 
# how many are triangle words?
